## What is the distillery?

The KILT Distillery is a on-ramp for people to build upon the core principles of KILT. KILT is a flexible protocol allowing builders and business to create or apdat to a specific usecase. The Distillery is a tool to give tools, recipes and the magic needed to start projects, adapt existing projects or start fresh.

The Distillery brings common workflows into code snipets or complete out the box solutions. The code and ideas here are open concepts to be built upon.

## Recipes

Recipes are intended for KILT builders to drop into the mixing bowl and build projects on and around KILT. These recipes are a collection with the intention of growing. Each of these recipes can be followed strictly, maybe experiementation to add an extra spice to the project.
